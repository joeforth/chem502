This part of the course happens in the first 4 weeks of CHEM502 and covers:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Cheminformatics
3. Introductory Machine Learning for Chemistry
4. More Introductory Machine Learning

Workshop materials will be uploaded the week of the workshop. Workshop solutions will be posted after the due date of each assignment.

Workbooks will be uploaded the week of each Workshop. Each workbook will have its own requirements.txt file containing the the python modules you need for each workshop.
